== NAME

fpmdiff - compare contents of Frugalware packages

== SYNOPSIS

fpmdiff [options] <fpm1> <fpm2>

== OPTIONS

--help::
	Display this manpage.

--version::
	Display the package version.

== DESCRIPTION

fpmdiff runs pacman-g2 -Ql for two packages and compares the two output. This
can be quite handy when you split packages.

For example you first build with --disable-kde, then with --enable-kde and
you'll see what new files have been installed: those files can be splitted to a
separate -kde subpackage.
