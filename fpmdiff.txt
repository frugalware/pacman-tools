== NAME

fpmdiff - compare contents of Frugalware packages

== SYNOPSIS

fpmdiff [options] <fpm1> <fpm2>

== OPTIONS

-c::
--clean-up::
	Perform some clean-up fixes in the packages files listings to reduce
	the differences due to package versioning.

-h::
--help::
	Display this manpage.

-v::
--version::
	Display the package version.

== DESCRIPTION

fpmdiff runs pacman-g2 -Ql for two packages and compares the two output. This
can be quite handy when you split packages.

For example you first build with --disable-kde, then with --enable-kde and
you'll see what new files have been installed: those files can be splitted to a
separate -kde subpackage.
