= syncpkgd(1)

== NAME

syncpkgd - a daemon that accepts requests from syncpkg clients

== SYNOPSIS

syncpkgd [options]

== DESCRIPTION

'syncpkgd' framework, the collection of scripts to build packages
automatically has the following components:

- 'syncpkgcd', the client daemon. There may be multiple client daemons,
  even for the same arch and they can be behind a firewall.
  Configuration lives in cconfig.py. It has an init script and it will
  request packages from syncpkgd from time to time.

- 'syncpkgd' itself, the daemon that controls the client daemons. There
  is only one 'syncpkgd' in the system, it accepts new build requests in
  an xmlrpc interface and provides packages for clients if they request
  ones. It is a single-thread application, and thus it needs a crontab
  file as well for maintenance tasks. Configuration lives in dconfig.py.
  It has an init script and then it will listen an a port, 1873 by default
  to accept requests from controllers and build clients.

- 'syncpkgdctl' is a sample client that controls syncpkgd, you can add
  new packages to the queue and you can query the queue as well.
  Configuration lives in ctlconfig.py.

- 'syncpkg-shell' is a special wrapper shell that allows using a single
  system account on the server for all syncpkgcd.
