What works:

- you can add a pkg

- you can request a pkg for a given arch

Requirements for clients:
- Ports:
  - no incoming ports required
  - outgoing: ssh, http
  - +smtp if external mail server used (see client config)
- repoman.conf: configured repos for the expected trees
- ssh keys: should be set up for password-less communication
