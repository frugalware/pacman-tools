== NAME

wipcheck - examines work in progress repositories

== SYNOPSIS

wipcheck [options]

== DESCRIPTION

The goal of this tool is to automatically check for trivial errors in a
WIP repo. First just run it and wait till it dies somewhere. If you
removed a package but a patch is still there for the removed package
then you have directories without FrugalBuild files and the script will
just die. Just run the re-run the script again and again till it does
not die.

Once you fixed these errors, you can run the script with the -q flag to
see missing (to be exact: not yet synchronized by syncpkgcds) binary
packages. The repo can be merged using fpmmerge in case that list is
empty.

== OPTIONS

-q::
	Quiet mode, just print errors and no output. Useful once you are
	sure about the script won't die anywhere.
