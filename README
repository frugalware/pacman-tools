= Tools for Pacman-G2
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>

== Summary

`pacman-tools` is a collection of handy scripts around `pacman-g2` to build and
maintain packages. The first stable Frugalware that shipped `pacman-tools` was
0.2 (Aurora).

== Requirements

These scripts are written in `bash`, `python` and `perl`, so you will need
those interpreters to use all of them. Additionally the following libraries are
required to use `mkiso`, the `ISO9660` install image generation tool:

* libpacman
* glib2
* libxml2

You need to have `asciidoc` installed, if you want to build the documentation.

== How to set it up

The usual

----
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
----

will work as expected.

To get the latest source using git:

----
$ git clone git://git.frugalware.org/pub/other/pacman-tools/pacman-tools
----

== I would like to have support for ...

If something does not work, then please report the issue to the
http://bugs.frugalware.org/[bug tracking system].

== Known bugs

* None at this time.

== Thanks

* Marcus Habermehl, for contributing `rpm2fpm`
* Vilmos Katona, for contributing `etcconfig`
* Bence Nagy, for the initial implementation of the `fwmakepkg` macro system
* Zsolt Szalai, for contributing `chkworld`, the no longer used `pud` and `rf`
  scripts and the initial implementation of `chkdep`
