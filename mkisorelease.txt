== NAME

mkisorelease - generates all net, cd* and dvd* iso images for a release

== SYNOPSIS

mkisorelease [options]

== OPTIONS

--help::
	Display this manpage.

--version::
	Display the package version.

== DESCRIPTION

This script is an initial attempt to do a fully automated update of the -iso
directory for a Frugalware release. It can do the net, cd* and dvd* images for
one arch at the moment.

Here is how it can be used:

----
$ cp /usr/share/doc/pacman-tools-*/volumes.xml ./
----

Edit `volumes.xml`, at least the version field. You can even remove it and then
a timestamp will be used.

When you're done, you can type

----
$ mkisorelease
----

to generate the isos.

Here is a list of what is _not_ updated at the moment:

* usb installer

* tftp image

* fwlive iso (it takes a lot of time)

* fwife iso

* chroot tarball

* the .ls-Ral files

* the `SHA1SUM` file

* the .torrent files

The last 3 items are done by typing `make`, you can get the `Makefile` from any
`frugalware-<tree>-iso` directory of your favourite Frugalware mirror.

The options passed to this script are passed to `mkiso`, so for example

----
$ mkisorelease -s
----

can be used for stable releases.
